# Logistic Regression for Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict customer satisfaction for an airline based on various features such as in-flight entertainment, flight distance, and class. The dataset contains 129,880 customer records and includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## 📋 Objectives

1. **Understand the Dataset**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
3. **Model Building**: Train a logistic regression model to predict customer satisfaction.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
